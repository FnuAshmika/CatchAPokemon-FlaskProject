This is a full-stack web application that displays Pokemon on the homepage, has a user page that displays the user's Pokemon, 
and a login/register page. Users can login, see a list of "available" Pokemon, and add Pokemon to their collection by clicking 
a button in the card for each Pokemon. They can add as many as they want, and when they navigate to their profile page, they can 
see a list of all the Pokemon they have collected.
